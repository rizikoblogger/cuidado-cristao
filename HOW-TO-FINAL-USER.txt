ATTENTION!

# When it is the first time you are running it for production, you have to create - signup -  
a brand new user. The first User will be an ADMIN by default. After that you have to create a 
brand new Church as [MOTHER]. Users should create their own credentials by themselves, because
Admins cannot do it.

# Developers should ignore this file and read README.md one.
